# Das Kapital (Java)
Das Kapital is a card game based off of Monopoly Deal. It was originally created by @wasiqm and I for our high school computer science summative. The original version of the game was written in Python. This is a complete remake of the game. Coded in Java, this version of the game keeps the core of the game the same but also features new additions such as an improved UI, modified veto cards and more.
